# Two-hop-Heuristic-to-solve-Influence-Maximisation

This is the code for my Honour thesis title "A Two-hop Heuristic approach to Solve Influence Maximisation". In this project,
I studied the classic information propagation model: Independent Cascade Model and develop a heuristic approach to the problem called 
Two-hop Heuristic. I compared my algorithm with others classic heuristic approaches such as: Degree Discount [[1]](#1), CELF, and High Degree.

**Abstract**

Technological advancements is evolving rapidly. With the rise of social media in recent years, the distribution of ideas, information and social phenomenon are now carried out
in a massive scale and more frequently than ever before. The challenge to determine infuential individuals whose opinions have significant impact over others is defined as
Inuence Maximisation Problem. This has seen popular applications in viral marketing, outbreak detection and rumour control. This project studies the Influence Maximisation Problem through the simulation study of baseline Greedy algorithm and development
of a computationally promising novel heuristic approach.
